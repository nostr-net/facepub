# Deterministic Biometric Nostr Key Generator

A web-based tool that generates deterministic Nostr keys from facial biometric data. The same face will always generate the same keys.

##  Important Notes

1. **Experimental**: This is a proof-of-concept for deterministic biometric key generation - DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION
2. **Security Considerations**: Facial features are not secret - anyone with your photo could potentially generate your keys
3. **Use Responsibly**: Consider this as an interesting experiment rather than a primary security method
